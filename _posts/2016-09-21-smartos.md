Check VM memory usage:
```
zonememstat -z 8a185b30-ad05-6a3a-fa20-fc190f229064
```
If you see the RSS column reaching it's CAP, and you're also seeing stats under NOVER (provides the number of times the instance has gone over its cap) and POUT (total amount of memory paged out when the zone has gone over its cap), the instance is likely suffering from memory exhaustion. 


Update VM:
```
vmadm update 0f256ca9-e2ce-6dd1-b8a8-9660132920c0 ram=2048
```
