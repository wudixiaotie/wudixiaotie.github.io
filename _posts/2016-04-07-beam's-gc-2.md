One erlang process is composed of a PCB, a Stack and a Private Heap.  


![Erlang Process]({{ site.url }}/images/erlang_process.png)


When a list or tuple is created in a process, there will be a pointer stacked in  
 the process stack, and the elements of the list or tuple created in private heap.  
The pointer in the stack points to the position of the elememts. Just like the  
 picture shows below:

{% highlight erlang %}
A = [a, b, c],
C = [x, r | A].
{% endhighlight %}
If A is part of C, just like the picture shows, only need to add object x, object r  
on heap.
