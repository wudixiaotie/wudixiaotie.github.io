One erlang process is composed of a PCB, a Stack and a Private Heap.  


![Erlang Process]({{ site.url }}/images/erlang_process.png)


When a list or tuple is created in a process, there will be a pointer stacked in  
 the process stack, and the elements of the list or tuple created in private heap.  
The pointer in the stack points to the position of the elememts. Just like the  
 picture shows below:


![List and Tuple]({{ site.url }}/images/list_and_tuple_layout.png)


{% highlight erlang %}
A = [a, b, c],
C = [x, r | A].
{% endhighlight %}
If A is part of C, just like the picture shows, only need to add object x, object r  
on heap.

Look at [this code](https://github.com/wudixiaotie/simple_im_client/blob/master/test/test_for_gc.erl), if we run test2, it cost about 100 times slower than test1,   
 but if we run bigheap2, it almost as fast as test1. Why? Because we increase the  
 min_heap_size of the process which we spawned, the min_heap_size option is threshold  
 of garbage collection. It is the size of the generation. If the min_heap_size is  
 large enough, the number of garbage collection will be very small. Usually min_heap_size  
 will be very small when beam spawn a new process, the garbage collector always grow  
 the heap step by step, but it is more costly than directly establishing a larger  
 heap when the process is spawned. The garbage collector can also shrink the heap   
 if it is much larger than the amount of data stored on it; setting the minimum   
 heap size prevents that.  


**The emulator probably uses more memory, and because garbage collections occur   
less frequently, huge binaries can be kept much longer.**
